# Global Inventory playbook command

High Level:
Command that will be present on the service that will run against ALL deployed apps in sandbox without need for a connection. The recommended methodology will be to run a large playbook and target the inventory groups of relevant resources.

1. Create separate command called "Run Global Inventory Playbook"
2. By default will run against "ALL" resources in sandbox, with a flag to target only apps with "Inventory Groups" attribute populated.
3. add custom "Inventory Groups" attribute to deployed app model and populate, service will look for this populated value, empty values ignored
